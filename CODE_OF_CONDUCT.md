# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project and community a welcoming experience for everyone.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Focusing on what is best for the community

Examples of unacceptable behavior:

- Trolling, derogatory comments, and personal attacks
- Public or private harassment of any kind
- Publishing others' private information without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to temporarily or permanently ban any contributor for behaviors that they deem inappropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, and also applies when an individual is representing the project or its community in public spaces.

## Enforcement

Instances of unacceptable behavior may be reported by opening a issue or contacting the maintainers directly. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/), version 2.1.
